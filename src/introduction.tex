\begin{frame}\frametitle{Introduction} 
Ocean Color refers to the multi-colored ocean map products created from the measurements of chlorophyll by global satellites. The satellites, equipped with multispectral scanners, collect water-leaving radiances and assess the absorptive properties of the Earth’s oceans.

Ocean color products are useful to gain insight of the physical and chemical processes occurring in Earth’s oceans. Chlorophyll concentration maps can be used for climate studies, measuring the salinity of oceans, estimating carbon exchange between oceans and atmosphere, and studying phytoplankton species.
