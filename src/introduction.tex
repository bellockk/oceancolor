Ocean Color refers to the multi-colored ocean map products created from the measurements of chlorophyll by global satellites. The satellites, equipped with temporal scanners, collect water-leaving radiances of the Earth’s oceans.

Ocean color products are useful to gain insight of the physical and chemical processes occurring in Earth’s oceans. Chlorophyll concentration maps can be used for climate studies, measuring the salinity of oceans, estimating carbon levels of ocean regions, and studying phytoplankton species.
