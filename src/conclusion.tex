\begin{frame}\frametitle{Conclusion} 
Ocean color is best sensed by global satellites to fully capture all available data for accurate analysis. Calculations are performed to compare differing levels of chlorophyll in the Earthâ€™s oceans in different seasons or years. The chlorophyll levels offer insight on the non-water contents of the oceans to monitor for potentially harmful changes. Chlorophyll levels are affected primarily by water temperature, water currents, and nutrient levels. Significant shifts in chlorophyll concentrations can indicate the occurrence of certain events. Ocean color mapping is a useful tool to find the source of problematic events so problem solving can begin.
