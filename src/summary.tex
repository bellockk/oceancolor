\begin{frame}\frametitle{Summary} 

  \note[item] These studies on ocean color discuss the evolution of chlorophyll-a measurements through advancements in remote sensing capabilities stemming from:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Refining instrument calibration and assimilating datasets for long-term reanalysis.
    \item Better understanding of the effects of inter-annual and irregular climate phenomena on NPP and Phytoplankton absorption.
    \item Redesign of Chlorophyll-a algorithms for distinguishing between different absorptive ocean water constituents. 
  \end{itemize}
  All of these advancements have profound implications for a more clear understanding of the ocean's contribution to the Earth's carbon cycle.
